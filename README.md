Master Dissertation - R script

This repository is part of my master dissertation and was created to share the R code used in the analysis.

It analyzes the standard procedure of the political representatives in Brazil who are responsible for the 
granting of tax benefits related to PIS, COFINS and CSLL to economic sectors and activities in the country 
during the governments of Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995-2002) and Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva (2003-2010). 
The main objective is to contribute to the political science literature that examines the Brazilian electoral 
connection and the role of executive and legislative branches in formulating public policy. 
The central hypothesis is that the formulation of these policies is subject to the agenda of the governing 
coalition and can not be attributed to the individual desires of Brazilian politicians, due to the pattern of 
concentration of powers within the legislative process. With a mixed methods design, we have adopted the legal 
provisions that grant and restrict access to tax benefits as the main unit of analysis. The conclusions point to the 
absence of an electoral connection based on the individual activity of the political representative, since other 
variables beyond the electoral system influence the behavior of the Brazilian representatives as well as the acquisition
of benefits by sectors and activities of the national economy. Instead of being individually built, our analysis 
indicates that the relationship between state and interest groups in Brazil is built on party behavior.
